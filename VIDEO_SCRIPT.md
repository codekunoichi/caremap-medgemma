## The Script

### [0:00-0:10] HOOK — On Camera

*[Hold up the Tupperware pill crate. Let them see the size. Set it down in front of you.]*

> "This is my mother's medicine box. Fifteen medications. Every single day."

*[Pause one beat. Let it land.]*

---

### [0:10-0:45] THE PAIN — On Camera

> "My mother — we called her Amma — had Alzheimer's, diabetes, anemia, and hypertension. My father was 84 when her care started in Kolkata."

> "We had rotating ayahs — home health workers who changed every few weeks. Each new ayah would walk in, see this box, and we'd explain everything verbally. Which pill, what time, take with food, don't mix these two."

> "We put Bengali labels on little glass jars. And then we hoped. Hoped she remembered. Prayed that by night shift change, every pill had been given."

> "This went on for years. Until we lost her."

*[Brief pause. Steady breath.]*

---

### [0:45-0:50] THE BRIDGE — On Camera

> "I built CareMap so no family has to rely on hope."

---

### [0:50-1:35] FRIDGE SHEET DEMO — Screen Share + Face PiP

*[Switch to screen share showing HuggingFace app. Your face stays in the bottom corner.]*

> "CareMap uses Google's MedGemma to turn complex medical data into printable fridge sheets an ayah can follow on day one."

*[Show the Medications page]*

> "Page one: the medication schedule. Every pill has a time badge, food instructions, and plain-language warnings. No jargon. Sixth-grade reading level. All generated by MedGemma."

*[Show the Bengali translation page — LINGER here]*

> "And because our ayahs in Kolkata read Bengali, CareMap translates the entire sheet. Same layout, same safety information — in her language."

*[Show Care Gaps or Connections page briefly]*

> "Five pages total — medications, labs, care actions, imaging, and connections. A doctor we interviewed said: 'The ayah changes every week. How do you hand off care?' The fridge sheet is the handoff."

---

### [1:35-2:15] PROVIDER SIDE — Screen Share + Face PiP

*[Show Kaggle scorecard or eval tables]*

> "CareMap serves both sides of healthcare — one model, three modules."

> "On the provider side: India has one radiologist for every hundred thousand patients. X-ray reports wait 72 hours in a first-in, first-out queue. CareMap uses MedGemma's multimodal vision to read chest X-rays and surface critical cases first."

> "Same approach for lab results. Thousands of HL7 messages pour in daily from labs across the country. CareMap triages them so a dangerous potassium level doesn't wait behind routine results."

*[Flash the scorecard — 3 seconds]*

> "100% STAT recall on both triage modules — zero critical cases missed. HL7 triage: 80% overall accuracy. Medication safety: 90% pass rate across all 10 medications."

---

### [2:15-2:40] SAFETY + VISION — On Camera

*[Back to you on camera]*

> "To be clear — CareMap does not replace clinicians. It prioritizes their attention. Every result is still reviewed by a doctor. When the model is uncertain, it escalates to human review."

> "In India, most clinics don't have electronic health records. But they have phones. Foundation models can turn photos of medicine boxes and lab reports into structured data — creating the input CareMap needs, even without an EHR."

---

### [2:40-3:00] CLOSE — On Camera

*[Pick up the pill crate]*

> "I named the patient in CareMap 'Amma' — because I built this for her."

> "It is open source. Any health system in India can use these three modules today."

> "I built CareMap because I wished it existed when she was alive. No family should have to hope and pray that the ayah remembered."

*[Set down the crate gently. Hold for one beat. End.]*

## What Changed (v2)

| Change | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Added "CareMap does not replace clinicians" line | Judges need to hear human-in-the-loop explicitly. ChatGPT was right about this. |
| Moved eval numbers into a confident rapid-fire list | State, don't defend. Fill in actual numbers after Kaggle run. |
| Cut "And speed? Healthcare has natural wait times..." | Was slightly defensive. If nobody asked, don't answer. |
| Tightened the pain section by 5 seconds | Freed room for the safety line without going over 3 min. |
| Changed "Until Amma passed" to "Until we lost her" | Slightly easier to deliver steadily on camera. Same emotional weight. |
| Kept the personal opening, Bengali moment, emotional close | These are non-negotiable. They are what judges will remember. |
| Did NOT adopt the generic "A caregiver stands in the kitchen" opening | Your real pill crate beats any hypothetical. |
| Did NOT collapse modules into one sentence | Judges need to see what you built. The demo IS the proof. |
| Did NOT adopt "CareMap is not automation, it is augmentation" close | "I wished it existed when she was alive" is stronger. |

## Practice Notes

- **Total word count: ~480 words.** At natural speaking pace (170 words/min), this fits 3 minutes with comfortable pauses.
- **The hardest moment** is "Until we lost her" followed by the bridge. Practice this transition 10+ times. Take a full breath after "lost her." The silence is powerful — don't rush past it.
- **Bengali page is your India moment.** Linger on it for 5-6 seconds. For the MedGemma Impact Challenge, this single visual — a professional medical document an ayah in Kolkata can actually read — says more than any architecture diagram.
- **Eval numbers are locked in.** Say them quickly and confidently — specific numbers signal rigor without eating time.
- **Don't memorize word-for-word.** Internalize the arc: pill crate -> pain -> bridge -> demo (Bengali!) -> provider + numbers -> safety line -> vision -> emotional close. The words will come.
- **"Until we lost her"** — if on a given take this feels too hard, you can also say "for years, until her care ended." Both work. Use whatever lets you stay steady.
