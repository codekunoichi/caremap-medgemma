Their insights directly shaped how MedGemma powers CareMap.\n\n---\n\n### The Need for Simple, Plain-Language Explanations\n\n**Dr. Vinodhini Sriram** (Primary Care Physician, US)\n\n> \"For the caregivers, I think it's mainly the medications. They are not going to care about the kidney function... **All they need is that first page which is the medication 8:00 a.m., 12 p.m., whatever it is.**\"\n\n> \"Absolutely. If the source of this data is reliable, **this is very good.**\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Transforms complex sig codes like \"PO BID AC\" into plain language: \"Take by mouth, twice daily, before meals.\"\n\n---\n\n### The Family Caregiver's Burden\n\n**Sunayana Mann** (Daughter/Family Caregiver)\n\n> \"If I had to drive her to the hospital, she cannot tell me all the medications and I might not be able to grab the whole bag. **So easiest would be... I peel the fridge magnet.**\"\n\n> \"**Task oriented for them** like I don't want them to think. I want to give them instructions and I want them to follow it like nothing extra.\"\n\n> \"**I'm not a medical professional.** I don't know all these things... I need someone to tell me what questions to ask.\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Generates \"Ask the Doctor\" prompts so families know what questions matter for their specific situation.\n\n---\n\n### The Reality of Healthcare in India\n\n**Dr. Manini Moudgal** (Pediatrician, Bangalore, India)\n\n> \"Given the volumes that we deal with over here, **EHR is a bloody headache**... We usually see **125-175 patients a day.**\"\n\n> \"The parents don't understand what I'm writing. They just want to know - **when do I give this medicine, how much, and what should I watch for?**\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Extracts the essential \"what, when, and watch for\" from clinical notes, eliminating jargon.\n\n---\n\n### Two Audiences, Two Levels of Detail\n\n**Dr. Gaurav Mishra** (Psychiatrist, Geriatric Focus)\n\n> \"**The pages for the ayah need to be even simpler**... for kids with autism sometimes we would use image based chart.\"\n\n> \"I would have **both levels available**... deep dive for family, simple for ayah.\"\n\n> \"The ayah changes every week. **How do you hand off care?** You can't expect verbal instructions to work.\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Generates separate pages for Ayahs (visual, task-focused) and Family (context, explanations, connections).\n\n---\n\n### Common Themes → CareMap Design Principles\n\n| User Research Insight | CareMap Response |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| \"All they need is medication times\" | Page 1: Medication Schedule with time/food badges |\n| \"I need someone to tell me what to ask\" | MedGemma generates \"Ask the Doctor\" prompts |\n| \"Two levels - deep dive and simple\" | Separate pages for Ayah vs Family audiences |\n| \"Ayah changes every week\" | Printable poster reduces reliance on verbal handoffs |\n| \"Don't omit medications\" | All 8 medications shown, nothing hidden |\n| \"Emergency contacts\" | Page 5: Who to call when something goes wrong |"

They just need to read, follow, and ask when something doesn't make sense.\n\n---\n\n## Model Attribution\n\n```bibtex\n@article{sellergren2025medgemma,\n  title={MedGemma Technical Report},\n  author={Sellergren, Andrew and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.05201},\n  year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Interactive Demo:** [CareMap on HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/codekunoichi/caremap-medgemma)\n\n*CareMap - Making healthcare information accessible and actionable.*"
