    "### Known Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abbreviation Echoing**: MedGemma sometimes echoes medical abbreviations from input (e.g., \"INR\", \"A1c\") despite prompt instructions to use plain language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cancer Term Leakage**: In rare cases with serious findings, the model may use the word \"cancer\" despite explicit prohibition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Variability**: As with all LLM outputs, results may vary between runs. The 90% pass rate represents typical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Post-processing validation can flag outputs with forbidden terms\n",
    "- Human review recommended for critical cases\n",
    "- Prompts include extensive forbidden term lists with plain-language alternatives"

This creates a critical challenge:\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Each new Ayah needs to learn the patient's medication schedule, warning signs, and care routine\n- The family caregiver (often an elderly spouse or busy adult child with a full-time job) must repeatedly explain everything\n- Patients who cannot speak or are cognitively impaired cannot instruct their own care\n- Critical information gets lost in translation, leading to medication errors\n\n**The Solution:**\nA **multilingual fridge sheet** that any Ayah can read in their native language, containing:\n- Clear medication schedule with timing\n- Warning signs to watch for\n- When to call the doctor\n- Daily care tasks\n\nBelow we generate a **Bengali** version of Dadu's fridge sheet - one of the most common languages among home health workers in Eastern India."
