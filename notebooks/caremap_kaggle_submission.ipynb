Their insights directly shaped how MedGemma powers CareMap.\n\n---\n\n### The Need for Simple, Plain-Language Explanations\n\n**Dr. Vinodhini Sriram** (Family Medicine, US)\n\n> \"For the caregivers, I think it's mainly the medications. They are not going to care about the kidney function... **All they need is that first page which is the medication 8:00 a.m., 12 p.m., whatever it is.**\"\n\n> \"Absolutely. If the source of this data is reliable, **this is very good.**\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Transforms complex sig codes like \"PO BID AC\" into plain language: \"Take by mouth, twice daily, before meals.\"\n\n---\n\n### The Family Caregiver's Burden\n\n**Sunayana Mann** (Daughter/Family Caregiver)\n\n> \"If I had to drive her to the hospital, she cannot tell me all the medications and I might not be able to grab the whole bag. **So easiest would be... I peel the fridge magnet.**\"\n\n> \"**Task oriented for them** like I don't want them to think. I want to give them instructions and I want them to follow it like nothing extra.\"\n\n> \"**I'm not a medical professional.** I don't know all these things... I need someone to tell me what questions to ask.\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Generates \"Ask the Doctor\" prompts so families know what questions matter for their specific situation.\n\n---\n\n### The Reality of Healthcare in India\n\n**Dr. Manini Moudgal** (Pediatrician, Bangalore, India)\n\n> \"Given the volumes that we deal with over here, **EHR is a bloody headache**... We usually see **125-175 patients a day.**\"\n\n> \"The parents don't understand what I'm writing. They just want to know - **when do I give this medicine, how much, and what should I watch for?**\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Extracts the essential \"what, when, and watch for\" from clinical notes, eliminating jargon.\n\n---\n\n### Two Audiences, Two Levels of Detail\n\n**Dr. Gaurav Mishra** (Child, Adolescent and Adult Psychiatrist)\n\n> \"**The pages for the ayah need to be even simpler**... for kids with autism sometimes we would use image based chart.\"\n\n> \"I would have **both levels available**... deep dive for family, simple for ayah.\"\n\n> \"The ayah changes every week. **How do you hand off care?** You can't expect verbal instructions to work.\"\n\n*How MedGemma helps:* Generates separate pages for Ayahs (visual, task-focused) and Family (context, explanations, connections).\n\n---\n\n### Common Themes to CareMap Design Principles\n\n| User Research Insight | CareMap Response |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| \"All they need is medication times\" | Page 1: Medication Schedule with time/food badges |\n| \"I need someone to tell me what to ask\" | MedGemma generates \"Ask the Doctor\" prompts |\n| \"Two levels - deep dive and simple\" | Separate pages for Ayah vs Family audiences |\n| \"Ayah changes every week\" | Printable poster reduces reliance on verbal handoffs |\n| \"Don't omit medications\" | All 8 medications shown, nothing hidden |\n| \"Emergency contacts\" | Page 5: Who to call when something goes wrong |"

   "source": "---\n\n## Deployment Pathways & Future Work\n\n### US Integration: Reducing Administrative Burden\n\nThe fridge sheet can become a standard discharge/checkout handout, printed alongside after-visit summaries that patients already receive. Rather than adding work, CareMap *reduces* the administrative burden on clinical staff: instead of manually writing plain-language instructions for each patient, the EHR data feeds directly into MedGemma, which generates the fridge sheet automatically. The clinician reviews and prints - no manual translation required.\n\nRadiology and HL7 triage modules integrate into existing EHR systems via standard HL7/FHIR interfaces with minimal workflow changes: incoming messages route through CareMap's priority classifier before reaching the existing review queue.\n\n### India & Low-Resource Settings\n\nWhere paper records dominate, MedGemma's multimodal capability enables a natural next step: caregivers photograph medication strips and upload outpatient lab reports. CareMap already handles structured data end-to-end; the gap is only the intake layer (image-to-structured-data), which MedGemma 1.5's vision capabilities are designed for. This would allow families in settings like Amma's, where prescriptions arrive as handwritten notes and lab reports as printed PDFs, to generate a fridge sheet from a phone camera.\n\n### Performance & Scalability\n\n**Fridge Sheets:** Healthcare wait times are pre-baked: patients already wait 15-30 minutes at checkout. CareMap's four interpreters (medication, lab, care gap, imaging) are independent functions with no shared state, making them trivially parallelizable. On a single T4, sequential generation takes ~10 minutes; with 4-way parallelism, this drops to ~3 minutes, well within existing checkout wait times. Translation is a follow-up pass after all four sheets are generated.\n\n**Radiology & HL7 Triage:** Each incoming HL7 message or X-ray image is an independent event with no FIFO ordering required. This enables horizontal scaling via event-driven architecture: messages arrive, fan out to available GPU workers (map), and results merge into the prioritized queue (reduce). A hospital processing 1,000+ HL7 messages/day can distribute across workers without coordination overhead.\n\n**Modular Architecture:** The codebase is designed so the foundation model can be swapped without large-scale refactoring. All MedGemma interactions flow through a single `MedGemmaClient` class; replacing the model requires changing only the `model_id` parameter. Similarly, the physician-auditable rule engine (CSV) is decoupled from model code. A healthcare institution can customize rules based on their patient population: evaluate historical records, identify the most prevalent diagnoses treated at that facility, and build targeted rules for those conditions first rather than attempting to cover the entire ICD diagnosis code tree.\n\n### Future Work: Scaling the Model\n\nAll evaluation in this notebook used `medgemma-1.5-4b-it` on a single T4 GPU (16GB VRAM). The framework is model-size agnostic: scaling to `medgemma-27b` requires only a larger GPU, not architectural changes. We expect the 27B model to improve radiology finding detection and reduce the current deliberate over-triage rate, and to produce richer, more nuanced medication explanations. Due to time and compute constraints, the 27B model was not evaluated in this submission; characterizing those gains is a priority for future work.",

Decoupling them solved the problem:\n\n| Metric | MedGemma Alone | MedGemma + Rule Engine | Improvement |\n|--------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| Overall Accuracy | 42% | **50%** | +8pp |\n| STAT Recall | **0%** (0/3) | **100%** (3/3) | 0 to 3 critical cases caught |\n| ROUTINE Recall | 33% | Improved | Deliberate over-triage by design |\n\n**Why the combined approach wins:** MedGemma 1.5 is excellent at *detecting what's in the image* (edema, effusion, cardiomegaly) but poor at *mapping findings to clinical urgency*. It classified everything as SOON or ROUTINE, missing all three critical cases. The rule engine maps detected findings to clinically validated priorities.\n\n**The fix: play to each system's strengths.**\n\n| Task | Best At | System |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Visual finding detection | Pattern recognition in pixels | MedGemma (multimodal) |\n| Priority assignment | Clinical judgment, protocols | Rule engine (physician-authored CSV) |\n\nThe architecture decouples detection from prioritization:\n\n```\nMedGemma (multimodal) -> findings list (what the model sees)\n         |\nRule Engine (CSV)     -> priority from matched findings\n         |\nFinal Priority = max(model_priority, rule_priority)\n```\n\n**Key design principles:**\n\n1. **Rules only escalate, never downgrade.** If MedGemma says STAT and rules say SOON, the patient stays STAT. Safety-first: we never reduce urgency.\n2. **\"No Finding\" forces ROUTINE.** The one exception - if MedGemma sees nothing abnormal, we override any erroneous SOON/STAT prediction down to ROUTINE.\n3. **Physician-auditable.** All rules live in a single CSV (`radiology_priority_rules.csv`) with columns: `finding_pattern`, `min_priority`, `rule_name`, `clinical_rationale`. A clinician can review and adjust without touching code. *Rules validated by Dr. Vinodhini Sriram.*\n4. **Transparent overrides.** Every triage result records the original model priority, the final priority, and which rules fired - enabling the diagnostic table below.\n\nThis is a general pattern for clinical AI: **use the model for perception, use rules for decision-making.** The model output becomes evidence; the rules encode clinical protocols that a human expert can audit and update.",

   "source": "### Evaluation Takeaways\n\n**What the metrics mean clinically:**\n\n- **STAT Recall** is the single most important metric for triage modules. A missed STAT case (false negative) means a critical patient waits in the routine queue, potentially for 72 hours. CareMap is designed to *over-triage* rather than *under-triage*: defaulting to STAT when uncertain ensures no critical findings are missed.\n\n- **Safety Pass Rate** for medication interpretation validates that MedGemma's plain-language output does not contain forbidden diagnosis terms (e.g., \"cancer\"), medical jargon, or specific numeric values that caregivers should not act on.\n\n- **No Forbidden Terms** for lab interpretation ensures that MedGemma follows the golden specification: no raw lab values (e.g., \"8.4%\", \"42 mL/min\"), no medical abbreviations (e.g., \"CKD\", \"eGFR\"), and no clinical jargon that a 6th-grade reader would not understand.\n\n**Limitations and honest caveats:**\n\n1. **Non-deterministic LLM** - MedGemma outputs vary between runs, hardware, and dtype. These scores represent a single evaluation pass.\n2. **Curated datasets** - The 25 X-rays and 20 HL7 messages are hand-selected to cover the priority distribution. Real-world performance on thousands of studies may differ.\n3. **Safety validation is rule-based** - The `SafetyValidator` catches known patterns (forbidden terms, jargon, measurements) but cannot detect all forms of misleading output.\n4. **No human expert review** - These automated metrics are a necessary first step; clinical validation with radiologists and physicians is the next milestone.",

They just need to read, follow, and ask when something doesn't make sense.\n\n---\n\n## Model Attribution\n\n```bibtex\n@article{sellergren2025medgemma,\n  title={MedGemma Technical Report},\n  author={Sellergren, Andrew and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.05201},\n  year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Interactive Demo:** [CareMap on HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rgiri2025/caremap-medgemma)\n\n*CareMap - Making healthcare information accessible and actionable.*",
