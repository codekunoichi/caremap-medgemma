## Key Themes Across All Interviews

### 1. Two Distinct Audiences
Every interviewee emphasized that **Ayahs and Family Caregivers have different needs**:

> **Dr. Vinodhini Sriram:** "For the caregivers, I think it's mainly the medications. They are not going to care about the kidney function... All they need is that first page which is the medication 8:00 a.m., 12 p.m., 6 a.m., whatever it is."

> **Sunayana Mann:** "You are basically pursuing two personas... one is you're talking about an ayah, the second... condensed the care team information for somebody who needs to view quickly."

> **Dr. Gaurav Mishra:** "I would have both the levels available... where if my cousin is going to go very deep into what's the best possible option... they're not doing the day-to-day caregiving. So they have the next person, they're able to bring it all down."

### 2. Medication Schedule is the Most Critical Page

> **Dr. Vinodhini Sriram:** "This page is the valuable page." [referring to medication schedule]

> **Sunayana Mann:** "If my mother is taking 15 medicines... and I had to drive her to the hospital, she cannot tell me all the medications and I might not be able to grab the whole bag. So easiest would be... I peel the fridge magnet."

### 3. Simplicity is Essential for Ayahs

> **Sunayana Mann:** "Why can't we use symbols? Morning symbol... with food then you just make a plate... so much of written information is not helpful because you'll be giving her verbal instructions."

> **Dr. Gaurav Mishra:** "The pages for the ayah need to be even simpler... for kids with autism sometimes we would use image based chart... even that level of simplicity if you're talking about really that level of outreach."

> **Sunayana Mann:** "Task oriented for them like I don't want them to think. I want to give them instructions and I want them to follow it like nothing extra."

### 4. India's EHR Gap

> **Dr. Vinodhini Sriram:** "Unfortunately in India they don't have this kind of robust EHR. Not even Apollo has it... There is no concept of discrete data."

> **Dr. Manini Moudgal:** "Given the volumes that we deal with over here, EHR is a bloody headache... We usually see 125-175 patients a day."

> **Dr. Gaurav Mishra:** "Care in India is fragmented... my mom gets her diabetes care from two or three different people randomly."

### 5. Caregiver Stress is Real

> **Dr. Manini Moudgal:** "By the end of it I had lost my marbles... I was depressed, I had to go on antidepressant because I had to keep my sanity to go through all of this."

> **Sunayana Mann:** "I was so inspired by her [a retired teacher]... we've been so busy that we don't stop and enjoy the little things that we have."

### 6. Checklist and Verification

> **Sunayana Mann:** "If they laminate it and put it on a fridge. Does she have a pen and she'll go like this is done, this is done, this is done."

> **Dr. Gaurav Mishra:** "You want like a... bathroom clean list. That is a level of list you want."

### 7. Emergency Contacts are Essential

> **Sunayana Mann:** "When something happens it needs to be generic information like when you have to call 911... who to call."

> **Dr. Gaurav Mishra:** "Call this number if you have a question."

## Specific Recommendations

### From Dr. Vinodhini Sriram (PCP)
- **Target assisted living facilities** run by/for Indians in Houston, Atlanta
- **Don't omit medications** - print everything
- **Translation is valuable** for multilingual caregivers
- Works well in US where EHR data is available

### From Sunayana Mann (Daughter)
- **Use symbols** (sun/moon for time, plate for food)
- **Laminate the sheet** for durability and check-off
- **Two fridge magnets**: one for medications, one for upcoming tasks
- **Separate by time buckets**: before 10am, 10-11am, 2-3pm
- **Remove cognitive burden** - no decision making for ayah

### From Dr. Manini Moudgal (Pediatrician)
- **Notebook system works** for non-critical patients
- **Volume is the challenge** - 125+ patients/day
- **Handover is the problem** - when ayah changes
- **Personal caregiving experience** informs design

### From Dr. Gaurav Mishra (Psychiatrist)
- **Picture-based for low-literacy** ayahs
- **Avoid per-medication warnings** - create a single "don't give these" list
- **Clear next steps** are critical
- **Simplify language** - "blood sugar" not "diabetes management"
- **Drug interactions**: warn to ask doctor, don't alarm
- **Both levels available**: deep for family, simple for ayah

## Validation of Concept B (5-Page Approach)

All four interviewees preferred **Concept B (multi-page, no omission)** over Concept A (single page with omissions):

| Aspect | Concept A | Concept B | Preference |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Medications | 8 max | All shown | **Concept B** |
| Information | Condensed | Complete | **Concept B** |
| Pages | 1 | 5 | **Concept B** |
| Risk | AI omission | None | **Concept B** |

> **Dr. Vinodhini Sriram:** "Print everything."

> **Sunayana Mann:** "I won't remember all the medications... at least they will know that she's on warfarin, metformin."

## Design Principles Validated

1. **Sixth-grade reading level** - confirmed by all
2. **No diagnosis or treatment recommendations** - confirmed
3. **Action over information** - especially for ayah pages
4. **Fail closed** - don't omit, don't speculate
5. **Questions for the doctor, not answers** - validated by Dr. Gaurav
