## Primary Care Physician

### Trust & Safety
1. Would you feel comfortable giving either version to a patient's family? Why/why not?
2. What information, if omitted, could lead to a medication error or missed warning sign?
3. The AI decides what's "important" in Concept A - does that concern you?

### Clinical Utility
4. For a complex patient like Dadu (12 meds, 5 conditions), which approach would you recommend?
5. Would you use this as part of discharge planning or after-visit summaries?
6. What's missing that you'd want caregivers to know?

### Practical
7. How do your patients' families currently manage medication information?
8. What do they get wrong most often?

## Clinical Psychologist

### Cognitive Load
1. For a stressed caregiver, which format is less overwhelming?
2. Does the 4-page approach create anxiety, or does "nothing omitted" create reassurance?
3. How do caregivers typically handle information overload?

### Health Literacy
4. Is the language simple enough for someone without medical background?
5. What would make this more accessible?

### Caregiver Wellbeing
6. Does separating "Ayah tasks" from "Family caregiver context" reduce burden or create confusion?
7. What role does confidence/trust play in caregiver stress?

## Daughter Caregiver

### Usability

3. Is anything confusing or unclear?

### Real-World Fit
4. Do you currently have anything like this? What do you use instead?
5. Would you trust an AI-generated summary, or would you verify with the doctor?
6. If hiring a helper/Ayah, which version would you give them?

### Completeness vs Simplicity
7. Does seeing "4 medications not shown" worry you, or is less actually easier?
8. What would make you feel confident nothing important was missed?
