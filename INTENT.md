# Project Intent – CareMap

CareMap exists to support **caregiving under cognitive load**.

It is designed for the moments when care is happening outside clinics and hospitals — in kitchens, bedrooms, and living rooms — where responsibility is high, information is fragmented, and mistakes are easy to make.

This project is grounded in lived caregiving experience, not abstract workflow diagrams.

## The Problem We Are Addressing

Caregivers managing chronic illness and multiple medications face a daily reality of:
- polypharmacy with complex timing and interaction risks
- unclear priorities across “urgent,” “soon,” and “eventual” care tasks
- medical language that assumes clinical training
- digital portals that overwhelm rather than guide

Most health systems optimize for **documentation and billing**, not for the human work of care.

CareMap intentionally shifts the center of gravity toward the caregiver.

## Who CareMap Is For

CareMap is designed for:
- family members managing care for parents, spouses, or relatives
- patients who rely on others to help organize daily care
- caregivers without medical training
- households where care responsibilities are shared

CareMap assumes:
- limited time
- emotional fatigue
- imperfect memory
- intermittent access to technology

---

## Who CareMap Is *Not* For

CareMap is not intended to:
- replace clinicians or clinical decision-making
- serve as a diagnostic or treatment tool
- manage acute or emergency care
- function as a complete medical record

CareMap does not attempt to “solve healthcare.”
It solves a **small, human problem well**.

## Core Design Beliefs

1. **Action beats information**  
   Caregivers need to know what to do next, not everything that is known.

2. **One page is a feature, not a limitation**  
   Constraint forces prioritization and reduces cognitive overload.

3. **Plain language is safer than precision**  
   Clarity prevents more harm than hyper-accuracy in non-clinical settings.

4. **Silence is better than speculation**  
   When information is missing or uncertain, CareMap refuses to guess.

5. **Care happens offline**  
   Paper, memory, and shared spaces still matter.

## Ethical Posture

CareMap is built with explicit boundaries:
- no diagnosis
- no medication changes
- no dosage recommendations
- no urgency escalation beyond fixed safety rules

The system is designed to **fail closed** — producing less output rather than unsafe output.

---

## Why This Matters

In many caregiving situations, errors are not caused by negligence or lack of intelligence, but by:
- exhaustion
- fragmented instructions
- competing responsibilities
- unclear priorities

CareMap exists to reduce avoidable harm by making care **simpler, calmer, and more navigable**.

---

## Scope Discipline

For this project and its initial release:
- the primary artifact is a **one-page caregiver fridge sheet**
- all features must justify their presence under real-world caregiving constraints
- advanced workflows (including agentic systems) are intentionally deferred

CareMap prioritizes **doing less, well**.

---

CareMap is built on the belief that **clarity is an act of care**.
